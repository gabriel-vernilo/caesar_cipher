# Encoder and Decoder of Caesar Cipher

a Encoder and Decoder of Caesar Cipher, my second project in Rust Lang.

## Caesar Cipher

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet

### Prerequisites

You need to install Rust Compiler (rustc)

https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install



```
$ rustc -V
rustc 1.46.0 (04488afe3 2020-08-24)
```

### Installing

compile using the command :

```
rustc caesar.rs
```

now you have the executable, just run it

```
./caesar
```

## Running

now enter the text, after you enter the shift.

example: 

```

type a text to encode with caesar cipher:
> abcxyz
type:
encode
decode
:
> encode
type the shift:
> 3
encoded: defabc

```
